Designed and developed a real-time vehicle monitoring system using the PIC18F4580 microcontroller, emphasizing efficient embedded system architecture. The system interfaces with analog sensors via ADC channels to monitor parameters such as vehicle speed, and detects gear changes, logging each event into external EEPROM with accurate timestamps provided by an RTC module using the I2C protocol. Real-time data is communicated through UART to Tera Term for monitoring and debugging, while a Character LCD (CLCD) offers immediate on-device feedback. The embedded C firmware, developed in MPLAB, was optimized for memory efficiency and reliable real-time performance.
